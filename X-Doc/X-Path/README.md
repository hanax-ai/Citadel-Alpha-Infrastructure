**Total Storage:** ~77GB across 5 models

### Execution Guidelines

#### Before Starting Any Task:
1. **Review .rulesfile:** `/opt/citadel-02/.rulesfile`
2. **Verify system state:** All 5 models operational
3. **Check dependencies:** Previous tasks completed
4. **Validate environment:** Python 3.12, Ollama service running

#### Task Execution Order:
```bash
# Phase 1: Foundation (Sequential)
Task_1.1_System_Preparation.md
Task_1.2_Python_Environment.md  
Task_1.3_Ollama_Configuration.md
Task_1.4_Configuration_Management.md

```

### Results Tracking

Each completed task should create a result file:
```
/opt/citadel-02/X-Doc/results/Task_X.X_Results.md
```

### Template Compliance

All created tasks follow the standardized template:
- ✅ Rules compliance checklist
- ✅ System state validation
- ✅ SMART+ST validation framework
- ✅ Model-specific considerations
- ✅ Detailed execution steps
