  "result": {
    "name": "mixtral_embeddings-2025-07-15-14-30-00.snapshot",
    "creation_time": "2025-07-15T14:30:00Z",
    "size": 1024
  }
}

[2025-07-15 14:30:02] INFO: Backup completed successfully
```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Backup failure | Medium | High | Monitor backup status, implement alerts |
| Storage capacity issues | Medium | Medium | Monitor backup storage, implement cleanup |
| Corruption during backup | Low | High | Verify backup integrity, test restoration |
| Automated backup conflicts | Low | Medium | Schedule during low-usage periods |

## Rollback Procedures

**If Task Fails:**
1. Remove backup scripts:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /opt/citadel/scripts/backup_collections.sh
   sudo rm /opt/citadel/scripts/restore_collections.sh
   ```
2. Remove cron job:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /etc/cron.d/qdrant-backup
   ```
3. Clean backup directory:
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /opt/qdrant/backups/*
   ```

**Rollback Validation:**
```bash
# Verify rollback completion
ls -la /opt/citadel/scripts/backup*
crontab -l | grep backup
ls -la /opt/qdrant/backups/
```

| Backup script errors | Script execution failures | Check permissions, verify paths |
| Storage full | Backup failures due to space | Clean old backups, expand storage |
| Cron job not running | No automated backups | Verify cron service, check job syntax |

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Backup diagnostics
journalctl -u cron -f
ls -la /opt/qdrant/snapshots/
df -h /opt/qdrant/backups/

# Qdrant snapshot API test
curl -X GET "http://192.168.10.30:6333/collections/mixtral_embeddings/snapshots"

# Script diagnostics
bash -x /opt/citadel/scripts/backup_collections.sh
```

- [ ] Update project status dashboard
- [ ] Communicate backup schedule to stakeholders

## Notes

This task implements a basic but effective backup strategy suitable for the R&D environment. The approach balances data protection with operational simplicity, avoiding complex backup infrastructure while ensuring data recovery capabilities.

**Key backup features:**
- **Daily Automated Backups**: Scheduled during low-usage periods (2 AM)
- **7-Day Retention**: Appropriate for R&D environment lifecycle
- **Collection-Level Snapshots**: Granular backup and recovery options
- **Verification Procedures**: Ensure backup integrity and recoverability
- **Monitoring**: Track backup success and failures

The backup configuration provides adequate protection for the R&D phase while maintaining operational simplicity. For production deployment, this foundation can be extended with more sophisticated backup strategies.
