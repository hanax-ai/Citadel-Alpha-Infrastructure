## Rollback Procedures

**If Task Fails:**
1. Restore original configurations:
   ```bash
   # Restore GPU configuration
   sudo cp /opt/citadel/backups/gpu_config.yaml /opt/citadel/config/gpu_config.yaml
   
   # Restore API configuration
   sudo cp /opt/citadel/backups/api_config.yaml /opt/citadel/config/api_config.yaml
   
   # Restore database configuration
   sudo cp /opt/citadel/backups/database_config.yaml /opt/citadel/config/database_config.yaml
   ```

2. Restart services with original configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart embedding-service
   sudo systemctl restart vector-api
   sudo systemctl restart qdrant
   ```

3. Remove optimization artifacts:
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /opt/citadel/optimization/results/
   sudo rm -rf /opt/citadel/optimization/logs/
   ```

**Rollback Validation:**
```bash
# Verify services are running with original configuration
curl -X GET "http://192.168.10.30:8000/health"
curl -X GET "http://192.168.10.30:6333/health"

# Run baseline performance test
