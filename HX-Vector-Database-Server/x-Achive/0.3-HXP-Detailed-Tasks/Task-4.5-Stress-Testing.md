| Hardware damage from stress | Low | High | Monitor temperatures, implement hardware protection |
| Test environment contamination | Medium | Medium | Use isolated test environment, implement cleanup |

## Rollback Procedures

**If Task Fails:**
1. Emergency stop all stress tests:
   ```bash
   pkill -f stress_scenarios
   pkill -f failure_injection
   sudo systemctl stop embedding-service
   sudo systemctl stop vector-api
   ```
2. System recovery:
   ```bash
   # Restart all services
   sudo systemctl start embedding-service
   sudo systemctl start vector-api
   sudo systemctl restart qdrant
   ```
3. Clean up stress test artifacts:
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /opt/citadel/stress_tests/results/
   sudo rm -rf /opt/citadel/stress_tests/logs/
   ```

**Rollback Validation:**

curl -X GET "http://192.168.10.30:6333/health"
nvidia-smi  # Check GPU status
free -h  # Check memory status

## Notes

This task implements comprehensive stress testing that evaluates system behavior under extreme conditions and validates recovery capabilities. The testing identifies breaking points and ensures system resilience under adverse conditions.

**Key stress testing features:**
- **Resource Exhaustion Tests**: Test system behavior under resource constraints
- **Extreme Load Tests**: Push system beyond normal operating limits
- **Failure Injection**: Simulate various failure scenarios
- **Recovery Validation**: Ensure system can recover from stress conditions
- **Breaking Point Analysis**: Identify system limits and failure modes
- **Resilience Assessment**: Evaluate overall system robustness

The stress testing provides critical insights into system limits and recovery capabilities, ensuring the system can handle unexpected extreme conditions gracefully.
