## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the mandatory coding standards and best practices for all software development projects within [Project or Department], specifically focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) methodologies. Adherence to these standards is crucial for ensuring code quality, maintainability, scalability, and collaborative development.

These rules are designed to promote:
* **Clarity and Readability:** Code that is easy to understand.
* **Maintainability:** Code that is easy to update and fix.
* **Scalability:** Code that can grow and adapt to new requirements.
* **Testability:** Code that can be effectively tested.
* **Consistency:** A unified approach across all projects and developers.

## 2. Foundational OOP Principles (Mandatory Adherence)

All code must demonstrate a clear understanding and application of the four core OOP principles:

* **2.1. Encapsulation:**
    * **Rule:** Object state (data) must be protected. Direct access to instance variables from outside the class is forbidden.
    * **Guideline:** Utilize `private` or `protected` access modifiers for internal data. Expose functionality through public methods (getters/setters where appropriate, but prefer methods that describe an action or behavior).

* **2.2. Abstraction:**
    * **Rule:** Classes must expose only essential information, hiding complex implementation details.
    * **Guideline:** Use abstract classes and interfaces to define contracts and common behaviors without detailing their internal workings. Design public APIs clearly and concisely.

* **2.3. Inheritance:**
    * **Rule:** Use inheritance solely for "is-a" relationships where a subclass genuinely specializes a superclass.
    * **Guideline:** Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies. Prefer **composition over inheritance** when a "has-a" relationship is more appropriate.

* **2.4. Polymorphism:**
    * **Rule:** Design objects to exhibit behavior that varies based on their specific type at runtime.
    * **Guideline:** Leverage method overriding for specialization and method overloading for flexible parameter handling. Implement interfaces to achieve diverse polymorphic behavior. **Avoid excessive reliance on `instanceof` or type-switching where polymorphic method calls are appropriate.**

## 3. SOLID Principles (Strict Compliance Required)

The following SOLID principles are fundamental to good OOP design and must be rigorously applied:

* **3.1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
    * **Rule:** Each class and module must have one, and only one, reason to change. Its responsibilities must be narrowly defined and focused.
    * **Example Violation:** A `User` class that handles user authentication, data persistence, and email notifications.
    * *(Optional Visual Reference: Consider linking to a diagram explaining SRP for classes/modules in your documentation.)*

* **3.2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
    * **Rule:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions) must be open for extension, but closed for modification.
    * **Guideline:** New functionality should be added by extending existing code (e.g., via inheritance or implementing interfaces), not by altering stable, working code.
    * *(Optional Visual Reference: Consider linking to a diagram explaining OCP for class/module flow in your documentation.)*

* **3.3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
    * **Rule:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
    * **Guideline:** Derived classes must not change the expected behavior or violate the contracts of their base classes.

* **3.4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
    * **Rule:** Clients must not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    * **Guideline:** Prefer multiple small, client-specific interfaces over one large, general-purpose ("fat") interface.

* **3.5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
    * **Rule:** High-level modules must not depend on low-level modules; both must depend on abstractions. Abstractions must not depend on details; details must depend on abstractions.
    * **Clarification:** Frameworks and low-level implementations should depend on shared interfaces, not concrete implementations.
    * **Guideline:** Use dependency injection or service locators to manage dependencies. Rely on interfaces/abstract classes for inter-module communication, not concrete implementations.

## 4. General Coding Standards & Practices

* **4.1. Naming Conventions:**
    * **Rule:** All identifiers (classes, methods, variables, constants) must use clear, descriptive, and unambiguous names.
    * **Standard:** Adhere to [Specify Language/Framework Standard, e.g., Java: `camelCase` for methods/variables, `PascalCase` for classes; C#: `PascalCase` for public members, `camelCase` for private fields; Python: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes].
    * **Constants:** Constants should generally be in `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`) for Python or `PascalCase` for C#. Refer to language-specific guidelines.
    * **Avoid:** Generic names (e.g., `data`, `tmp`, `obj`), single-letter variables (unless in tight loops like `i, j, k`), or excessive abbreviations.

* **4.2. Code Readability & Formatting:**
    * **Rule:** Code must be consistently formatted and easy to read.
    * **Standard:** Follow [Specify Formatting Tool/Style Guide, e.g., Google Java Style Guide, Black for Python, Prettier for JS].
    * **Automation:** It's highly recommended to use an automated formatter (e.g., Black, Prettier, ClangFormat) via a pre-commit hook or CI step to ensure consistent formatting.
    * **Guideline:** Use appropriate indentation (e.g., 4 spaces, no tabs). Limit line length to 120 characters where possible. Add blank lines to separate logical blocks of code.
    * **Comments:** Use comments sparingly to explain *why* code does something, not *what* it does (unless the logic is non-obvious). Strive for self-documenting code.

* **4.3. Modularity & Cohesion:**
    * **Rule:** Break down large problems into small, highly cohesive units (classes, methods).
    * **Guideline:** Methods should ideally perform one specific task. Classes should have a single, well-defined responsibility (SRP).

* **4.4. Low Coupling:**
    * **Rule:** Minimize dependencies between distinct components (classes, modules).
    * **Guideline:** Avoid "God objects." Pass necessary dependencies as parameters or inject them.

* **4.5. Error Handling & Exception Management:**
    * **Rule:** Implement robust and predictable error handling.
    * **Guideline:** Use specific exceptions instead of generic ones. Handle exceptions at the appropriate layer. Log critical errors. Avoid silently catching and ignoring exceptions.

* **4.6. Unit Testing:**
    * **Rule:** All new features and significant bug fixes must be accompanied by comprehensive unit tests.
    * **Guideline:** Tests must be isolated, repeatable, and fast. Aim for high code coverage (target: [e.g., 80%]). Use mocking/stubbing frameworks to isolate dependencies.
    * **Organization:** All tests must be stored in a clearly defined `/tests` directory (or equivalent for your project structure) and follow the naming convention `test_<feature>.py` (or similar language-specific conventions).

* **4.7. Version Control (Git):**
    * **Rule:** Adhere to the established Git branching strategy.
    * **Strategy:** Adopt **GitHub Flow** once implemented. Until then, follow [Your Company's Interim Git Strategy].
    * **Guideline:** Commit small, atomic changes frequently. Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. Never commit directly to the `main`/`master` branch.

* **4.8. Code Reviews:**
    * **Rule:** All code changes must undergo a mandatory peer code review before merging into shared branches.
    * **Guideline:** Provide constructive and actionable feedback. Focus on adherence to these standards, design quality, and potential issues. Be open to receiving feedback and learning.

* **4.9. Design Patterns:**
    * **Guideline:** Leverage established OOP design patterns (e.g., Factory, Strategy, Observer, Decorator) as appropriate solutions to recurring design problems.
    * **Benefit:** Promotes reusable, scalable, and maintainable architectural solutions.

* **4.10. Refactoring:**
    * **Rule:** Continuously refactor code to improve its internal structure, readability, and adherence to principles without changing its external behavior.
    * **Guideline:** Perform refactoring in small, manageable steps, backed by robust test suites. For large-scale refactoring efforts, consult resources like Martin Fowlerâ€™s "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code."

* **4.11. Documentation:**
    * **Rule:** Public APIs (classes, methods, functions) must be clearly documented with their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions they might throw.
    * **Docstring Format:** Adopt a consistent docstring format, e.g., [Google-style, NumPy-style, Javadoc, Sphinx-compatible].
    * **Guideline:** For complex algorithms or design decisions, provide inline comments or external documentation explaining the "why."

## 5. File & Class Layout (Optional, but Recommended)

Establishing consistent file and class layout improves navigation and readability.

* **5.1. One Class Per File:**
    * **Rule:** Each top-level class should reside in its own dedicated file.
    * **Justification:** This improves code organization, simplifies version control, and makes it easier to locate specific classes.
    * **Exception:** Inner classes or small, tightly coupled helper classes may be co-located if justified for encapsulation or clarity.

* **5.2. Import Grouping:**
    * **Rule:** Imports should be logically grouped and ordered within a file.
    * **Guideline:** A common practice is to group imports in the following order, separated by a blank line:
        1.  Standard library imports.
        2.  Third-party library imports.
        3.  Local application/project-specific imports.

## 6. Compliance and Enforcement

Adherence to these coding standards is mandatory for all development activities at [Project or Department]. Compliance will be ensured through:

* **Automated Static Analysis:** Tools such as [e.g., SonarQube, ESLint, Checkstyle] will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically flag common code smells and deviations from standards. Violations will be logged in [e.g., SonarQube dashboard, GitHub Actions report].
* **Mandatory Code Reviews:** All pull requests will be subject to peer review, with emphasis on enforcing these standards.
* **CI Pipeline Enforcement:** CI pipelines will be configured to fail if style or static analysis checks do not pass, preventing non-compliant code from being merged.
* **Mentorship and Training:** Ongoing training, workshops, and mentorship will be provided to help developers understand and apply these principles effectively.
* **Project Lead Responsibility:** Project leads are responsible for guiding their teams in adopting and maintaining these standards.

Failure to consistently adhere to these standards may result in delayed merges, required rework, and impact on performance evaluations.
