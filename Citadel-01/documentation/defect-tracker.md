# Citadel LLM System - Defect Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks known issues, defects, and technical debt in the Citadel LLM system. Issues are categorized by severity and component to facilitate prioritization and resolution planning.

## Issue Classification
- **Critical**: System cannot function, data loss risk
- **High**: Major functionality impaired, workarounds difficult
- **Medium**: Functionality affected, workarounds available
- **Low**: Minor issues, cosmetic problems, enhancement requests

## Status Definitions
- **Open**: Issue identified, not yet addressed
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Resolved**: Fix implemented and tested
- **Closed**: Issue verified as resolved in production

### DEF-001: JSON Parsing Error in Ollama Response Handling ✅ **CLOSED**
**Component**: API Gateway - Ollama Integration  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Closed  
**Reported**: 2025-07-23  
**Resolved**: 2025-07-23 02:25:40 UTC  
**Resolution Time**: 19 minutes 40 seconds  
**Reporter**: System Integration Testing  

**Problem**: API requests to `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint returned JSON parsing error: "Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 123)", preventing end-to-end API functionality.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Model name mismatch - gateway accepted user names ("phi3") but Ollama required full names ("phi3:latest")
2. Inconsistent JSON response parsing for streaming vs non-streaming responses

**Resolution Applied**:
✅ **Model Name Mapping**: Implemented mapping from user-friendly names to Ollama model names  
✅ **JSON Parsing Fix**: Corrected logic to handle non-streaming responses properly  
✅ **Stream Parameter Control**: Always force `stream=false` for consistent response format  

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ phi3 model: Returns proper responses
- ✅ openchat model: Returns proper responses  
- ✅ All models (phi3, openchat, mixtral, nous-hermes2-mixtral) functional
- ✅ Database logging working correctly
- ✅ Health checks passing for all services
