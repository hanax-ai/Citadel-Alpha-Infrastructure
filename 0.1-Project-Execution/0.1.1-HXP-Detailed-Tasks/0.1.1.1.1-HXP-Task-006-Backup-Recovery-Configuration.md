## Risk Assessment

### Vector Database Server Specific Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Backup failure during critical operations | Medium | High | Implement backup monitoring, multiple backup methods, alerts |
| Storage capacity exceeded for backups | Medium | High | Monitor storage usage, implement retention policies, archive old backups |
| Recovery time exceeding acceptable limits | Medium | High | Optimize recovery procedures, implement incremental backups |
| Backup corruption or integrity issues | Low | High | Implement backup verification, checksums, multiple backup copies |
| Network failures affecting remote backups | Medium | Medium | Implement local backups, retry mechanisms, backup validation |
| Performance impact during backup operations | Medium | Medium | Schedule backups during low-usage periods, optimize backup processes |
| Security vulnerabilities in backup data | Low | High | Encrypt backups, secure backup storage, access controls |

## Rollback Procedures

1. **Backup Failure:** Investigate failure, fix issues, retry backup process
2. **Storage Issues:** Clean up old backups, expand storage, optimize retention
3. **Recovery Problems:** Use alternative recovery methods, restore from older backups
4. **Performance Impact:** Adjust backup schedules, optimize backup processes
5. **Security Issues:** Secure backup data, implement encryption, fix access controls
6. **Monitoring Problems:** Fix monitoring configuration, restore alerting

## Troubleshooting

### Vector Database Server Specific Issues

**Common Issues:**
| Issue | Symptoms | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Backup script failures | Backup jobs failing, error messages | Check script permissions, verify paths, check disk space |
| Snapshot creation errors | Qdrant snapshot API errors | Verify Qdrant status, check storage permissions, retry operation |
| Storage space issues | Backup failures due to space | Clean old backups, expand storage, implement retention policies |
| Recovery procedure failures | Recovery scripts failing | Verify backup integrity, check permissions, use alternative methods |
| Backup monitoring issues | Missing alerts, monitoring failures | Check monitoring configuration, verify log paths, test alerting |
| Performance impact during backups | Slow queries during backup | Optimize backup timing, reduce backup frequency, use incremental backups |

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Backup diagnostics
ls -la /opt/qdrant/backups/
df -h /opt/qdrant/backups/
tail -f /var/log/citadel/backup.log

# Qdrant snapshot diagnostics
