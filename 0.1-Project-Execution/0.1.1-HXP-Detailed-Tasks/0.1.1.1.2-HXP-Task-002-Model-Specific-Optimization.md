## Risk Assessment

### Vector Database Server Specific Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|

| Performance regression in some models | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing, rollback procedures, gradual deployment |
| Memory usage increase from optimizations | Medium | Medium | Monitor memory usage, optimize configurations, implement limits |
| Optimization complexity affecting maintenance | Medium | Medium | Document optimizations, simplify where possible, automated testing |
| Cache optimization inefficiency | Low | Medium | Monitor cache performance, adjust strategies, implement fallbacks |
| Query optimization breaking compatibility | Low | High | Maintain backward compatibility, test thoroughly, version control |
| Resource contention between models | Medium | Medium | Resource isolation, priority management, load balancing |

## Rollback Procedures

1. **Optimization Failures:** Disable model-specific optimizations, use default configurations
2. **Performance Regression:** Revert to previous optimization settings, test incrementally
3. **Memory Issues:** Reduce memory-intensive optimizations, implement monitoring
4. **Cache Problems:** Disable model-specific caching, use default cache settings
5. **Query Issues:** Revert query optimizations, use standard query patterns
6. **Resource Conflicts:** Isolate model resources, adjust resource allocation
