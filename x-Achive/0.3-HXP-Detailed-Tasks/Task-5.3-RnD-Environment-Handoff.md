| Stakeholder unavailability for handoff | Medium | Medium | Schedule flexibility, recorded demonstrations |
| System issues discovered during final validation | Low | High | Comprehensive pre-validation, issue resolution procedures |
| Incomplete knowledge transfer | Medium | Medium | Structured transfer sessions, documentation validation |
| Delayed Part 2 transition | Medium | Medium | Clear transition planning, resource allocation |

## Rollback Procedures

**If Task Fails:**
1. Document handoff issues:
   ```bash
   # Create issue log
   echo "Handoff failed: $(date)" >> /opt/citadel/logs/handoff_issues.log
   ```
2. Maintain R&D environment:
   ```bash
   # Ensure system remains operational
   systemctl status embedding-service
   systemctl status vector-api
   systemctl status qdrant
   ```
3. Schedule handoff retry:
   ```bash
   # Update handoff schedule
   echo "Handoff rescheduled for: TBD" >> /opt/citadel/handoff/schedule.log
   ```

**Rollback Validation:**
```bash
# Verify system remains operational
curl -X GET "http://192.168.10.30:8000/health"
curl -X GET "http://192.168.10.30:6333/health"
