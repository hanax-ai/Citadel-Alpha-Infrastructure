|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Deployment failure in production | Medium | High | Implement comprehensive testing, rollback procedures |
| Configuration errors during deployment | Medium | High | Use configuration validation, automated testing |
| Service downtime during deployment | Medium | Medium | Implement zero-downtime deployment strategies |
| Rollback failure | Low | Critical | Test rollback procedures, maintain multiple backup points |

## Rollback Procedures

**If Task Fails:**
1. Remove deployment artifacts:
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /opt/citadel/deployment/
   sudo rm -rf /opt/citadel/scripts/deploy*
   ```
2. Clean up deployment logs:
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /opt/citadel/logs/deployment/
   ```
3. Remove CI/CD integration:
   ```bash
   # Remove GitHub Actions workflows
   rm -rf .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   ```

**Rollback Validation:**
```bash
# Verify deployment artifacts are removed
ls -la /opt/citadel/deployment/  # Should not exist
ls -la /opt/citadel/scripts/deploy*  # Should not exist
```

journalctl -u deployment-service -f
```
