**Day 12: Final Documentation and Handover**

**Step 12.1: Create Operational Documentation**
```bash
# Create operational runbook
sudo tee /opt/citadel/docs/operational-runbook.md << 'EOF'
# Citadel LLM Server Operational Runbook

## Service Management

### Starting All Services
```bash
sudo systemctl start citadel-llm.target
```

### Stopping All Services
```bash
sudo systemctl stop citadel-llm.target
```

### Checking Service Status
```bash
sudo systemctl status citadel-llm@mixtral-8x7b.service
sudo systemctl status citadel-llm@hermes-2.service
sudo systemctl status citadel-llm@openchat-3.5.service
sudo systemctl status citadel-llm@phi-3-mini.service
sudo systemctl status citadel-llm-gateway.service
```

### Viewing Logs
```bash
# Service logs
sudo journalctl -u citadel-llm@mixtral-8x7b.service -f

# Application logs
tail -f /var/log/citadel-llm/api-gateway.log
tail -f /var/log/citadel-llm/mixtral-8x7b.log
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics URLs
- Prometheus: http://192.168.10.37:9090
- Grafana: http://192.168.10.37:3000
- Local Metrics: http://localhost:8000/metrics

### Health Checks
```bash
# Overall health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Individual model health
curl http://localhost:11400/health  # Mixtral
curl http://localhost:11401/health  # Hermes-2
curl http://localhost:11402/health  # OpenChat
curl http://localhost:11403/health  # Phi-3-Mini
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Won't Start**
   - Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u citadel-llm@<model>.service`
   - Verify model files exist
   - Check port availability
   - Verify memory availability

2. **High Memory Usage**
   - Monitor with: `htop` or `free -h`
   - Check model memory limits in config files
   - Consider restarting services

3. **Slow Response Times**
   - Check CPU usage: `htop`
   - Monitor request queues in metrics
   - Verify network connectivity

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Restart All Services**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart citadel-llm.target
   ```

2. **Emergency Stop**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop citadel-llm.target
   sudo pkill -f vllm
   ```

3. **Check System Resources**
   ```bash
   /opt/citadel/scripts/health-monitor.sh
   ```

## Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Weekly: Review logs and clean up old files
- Monthly: Update system packages
- Quarterly: Review and optimize configurations

### Backup Procedures
```bash
# Backup configurations
tar -czf /opt/citadel/backup/config-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /opt/citadel/config/

# Backup logs (if needed)
tar -czf /opt/citadel/backup/logs-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /var/log/citadel-llm/
```

**Issue Resolution Procedures:**

1. **Service Won't Start**
```bash
# Step-by-step troubleshooting for service startup issues

# 1. Check service status
sudo systemctl status citadel-llm@<model-name>.service

# 2. Check logs
sudo journalctl -u citadel-llm@<model-name>.service --since "10 minutes ago"

# 3. Check configuration
source /opt/citadel/config/<model-name>.env
echo "Model path: $MODEL_PATH"
echo "Service port: $SERVICE_PORT"
echo "Memory limit: $MEMORY_LIMIT"

# 4. Verify model files
ls -la $MODEL_PATH

# 5. Check port availability
netstat -tlnp | grep $SERVICE_PORT

# 6. Check memory availability
free -h

# 7. Manual start for debugging
cd /opt/citadel/llm-server
source /opt/citadel/env/bin/activate
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model $MODEL_PATH --port $SERVICE_PORT --host 0.0.0.0
```

2. **High Memory Usage**
```bash
# Memory usage investigation and resolution

# 1. Identify memory consumers
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10

# 2. Check model memory usage
systemctl show citadel-llm@*.service --property=MemoryCurrent

# 3. Check for memory leaks
valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model <model-path>

# 4. Restart services to free memory
sudo systemctl restart citadel-llm@<model-name>.service

# 5. Adjust memory limits if necessary
# Edit /opt/citadel/config/<model-name>.env
# Modify MEMORY_LIMIT value
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart citadel-llm@<model-name>.service
```

3. **Performance Issues**
```bash
# Performance troubleshooting procedures

# 1. Check CPU usage
htop

# 2. Monitor request queues
curl -s http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep llm_active_requests

# 3. Check response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -s -o /dev/null http://localhost:8000/health

# 4. Network latency check
ping -c 10 192.168.10.35  # Database
ping -c 10 192.168.10.30  # Vector DB
ping -c 10 192.168.10.37  # Metrics

# 5. I/O performance check
iostat -x 1 5

# 6. Optimize vLLM parameters
# Edit model configuration files to adjust:
# - MAX_NUM_SEQS
# - MAX_BATCHED_TOKENS
# - Enable/disable chunked prefill
```

This comprehensive implementation guide provides detailed procedures for deploying, operating, and maintaining the HXP-Enterprise LLM Server with systematic approaches that ensure reliable operation and optimal performance within the Citadel AI Operating System ecosystem.
